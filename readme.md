# Hello, I'm Eduardo Martinez and this is my branch!

Here I'll be sharing my progress, assignments and coding activities related to...

## My folder structure

I'll upload and organize my projects as follows:

- `Tasks` . This project will contain every small-code related task assigned after a given class, such as: coding problems(writing functions, smalls programs), OOP(working with classes and Kotlin language features) and cli programs. Each assignment will be placed inside its own package (`task1`,`task2`, ... `taskN`), and will have to be called (just uncomment those lines) at the `main` function inside the `Main.kt` class.

- _Any other folder_ . Will be an indivual project, an entire Kotlin app (or complex application) which could require a complex and its own folder structure(i.e an Android app).

## My projects

At this momment, I uploaded just 1 project.(`Tasks`)
